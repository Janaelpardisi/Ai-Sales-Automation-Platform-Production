## For Production Use

### Current Setup (Demo Mode)
```bash
# .env configuration
SERPAPI_KEY=Configured
APOLLO_API_KEY=Configured
USE_REAL_SEARCH=True
USE_REAL_EMAILS=True

# Email (Mailtrap - Test Mode)
SMTP_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
SMTP_PORT=587
```

### Production Setup (5 minutes)
Replace Mailtrap with Gmail/SendGrid:

```bash
# Gmail SMTP
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# OR SendGrid SMTP
SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=apikey
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-sendgrid-api-key
```

## What This Means

### Fully Functional
The project is **100% functional** with real data:
- Searches real companies on Google
- Finds real email addresses
- Generates personalized emails with AI
- Sends emails (currently to test inbox)

### Email Delivery
- **Now**: Emails go to Mailtrap (safe testing environment)
- **Production**: Change SMTP settings → emails go to real recipients

This is **best practice** for development - test with Mailtrap first, then switch to production SMTP when ready.
